    "text": "This portfolio analyzes trends in total energy production and consumption in the United States from 1950 to 2024, focusing on primary sources (fossil fuels, renewable energy, and nuclear power). As well as more specific energy source and their associated CO2 emissions. By following long-term patterns, this work aims to provide insights into the evolving U.S. energy landscape and its environmental impact."

Hoping to see that the production and consumption of renewable and nuclear electric energy will significantly increase over time, while fossil fuels use will decline.\nBy comparing the production and consumption across individual energy sources from 1973-2024, we can observe how each source has changed and contributes to its CO2 emissions."
